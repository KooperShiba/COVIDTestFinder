To resolve all project dependacies, please download the requrements.txt file. Run the following command in a Windows command prompt:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## To Do
✍️ Seperate functionality into smaller functions
✍️ Get all xPath variables into a single configuration file for easy and reliable updates
✍️ Seperate each retail store into it's own file and have a runner
✍️ Write an easy set-up guide in GitHub
✍️ Start work on a Telegram bot that takes zip codes as input
✍️ Write small guide on how xPaths were gathered.

❓ Figure out how to bipass Walmart's bot protections for complete automation
❓ Find reliable alternative from doing this:
```
service = Service(executable_path=ChromeDriverManager().install())
```

## Current Issues
⚠️ Zip Codes is being used as a global variable when it should be passed in.
⚠️ Walmart brute force function fails on second attempt.
⚠️ Target second page type is not accounted for
